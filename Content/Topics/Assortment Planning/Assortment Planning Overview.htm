        <p style="color: #000000;">The parameters you select during plan creation are the cornerstones of success in the assortment planning process. Business process discussions should be had prior to plan creation to understand the existing infrastructure into which plans will be integrated. If Merchandise Financial Planning and/or Allocations systems or processes are in place, assortment plans should be structured to facilitate the movement of data between them. Consider the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 38pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;color: #000000;">How is our business structured in terms of product? How many major categories are there and what subdivisions exist in each? What level of detail do we need inherent in our product hierarchy?</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;color: #000000;">How is our business structured in terms of selling channels? Do you need to segment by full and off-priced business, by country, by geography, some combination of all? Are there other factors related to site attributes (capacity, climate, demographic, etc.) that we use to group sites together?</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;"><span style="color: #000000;">What is the structure of our</span><span style="color: #000000;"> financial reporting periods structured and what calendar is used to track them?</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;color: #000000;">What will be our primary planning currency for financial targets and comparisons? Are there additional taxes or costs of doing business internationally to consider?</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="list-style-type: disc;color: #000000;">What are the primary metrics and/or attributes against which our business will be measured?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Points to consider</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;">It is vital that sufficient time is given to discuss the points presented above as well as to the pre-requisite steps outlined thereafter. Additionally, by taking the time to consider and set plan defaults that are appropriate to your business, you will streamline your workflow and save yourself a great deal of time as you plan. Consider the following points:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Attributes: </span>one of the strengths of the Demand Management Assortment Planning solution is that users have the ability to define business segments that are not directly tied to your product hierarchy. Spending time to strategize among your team and define what attributes are meaningful and then structuring your plan accordingly is a great way to uncover and address areas of opportunity with your plans</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Cluster Sets: </span><span style="color: #000000;">cluster sets are the cornerstone of Assortment Planning in Demand Management. Carefully consider the areas of your business that you want to plan different assortments for and/or those that will be managed by different individuals and create your cluster sets accordingly</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Price Translations: </span><span style="color: #000000;">for companies doing business internationally, there may be additional costs associated that can decrease your profit margin – import/export fees, tariffs, higher real estate prices, etc. Demand Management offers price translations as a way of simply creating premium pricing by </span><span style="color: #000000;">product hierarchy level, price range, and locale to help recoup those extra costs, if this is part of your corporate pricing strategy</span>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph" style="margin-top: 5pt;margin-bottom: 5pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Plan Defaults:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Demand Management Assortment Planning offers a wide array of defaults covering everything from cluster sets, seasonality, and size curves, to constraints such as periods of supply and pack tolerance % that are utilized as part of receipt planning and prepack optimization calculations. These can always be overridden later if needed, but taking the time to set defaults to cover the majority of cases will save you a great deal of time later</span>
