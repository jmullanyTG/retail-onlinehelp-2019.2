        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;">To facilitate a centralized approach to the creation and processing of outgoing product orders from all Demand Management modules, commitment orders for receipts planned in Assortment Planning are handled through the Order Manager module. Order Manager is located under the <span style="font-weight: bold;color: #000000;">Execute</span> tab on the main ribbon.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;text-align: center;color: #000000;">

        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2pt;color: #000000;">Within Order Manager, users can create, review, approve, and submit product orders to external systems through the integration established during implementation of the Assortment Planning software.</p>
