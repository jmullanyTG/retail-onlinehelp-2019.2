        <p>The Notification Subscription screen can be accessed by clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Notification Maintenance</span> from the <b>Maintenance</b> tab.</p>
        <p>It provides System Administrators the ability to subscribe users to receive solution notifications, initiated by user interaction. The screen is comprised of three (3) areas: Solution Subscriptions, Subscription Properties and Delivery descriptions with user interactions</p>
        <p>For each Demand Management solution, a set of Core and Custom Notifications may be subscribed to. Marking the checkbox at the solution level will include all Notifications associated to it. Notifications that are subscribed to, with delivery method, will be configured as the system default for all users/roles, unless overridden by User Preferences.</p>
