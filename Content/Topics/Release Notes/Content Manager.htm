        <h1>Content Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Content Manager module. </p>
        <h2>Modifications to Copy fields</h2>
        <p>As of 2019.1, the system will only update modified Content fields when saving changes. This is implemented at all levels (Master, Event, and Content) as well as updating the modifications to the other levels. This modification prevents unchanged fields from overwriting modified content.</p>
