        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Price Manager solution. </p>
        <h2>Changing multiple Price Action statuses at once</h2>
        <p>As of version 2019.2, you can change the status of multiple Price Actions at once thus avoiding having to open and change the status for each and every Price Action. The changing of multiple statuses at once is effected using a new Multiple Price Action Status dialog. Select Change Status(es) either in the Price Actions grid on the Price Manager screen or within the Pricing Plan’s Action grid. The system will allow the user to review all Pricing Actions, in the grid, that they have rights to transition to the next Status per each Price Action’s specific workflow.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Online Help"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-60475</MadCap:conditionalText></MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude,General.Online Help">.DMDEV-60474.DMDEV-60473.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h2>Cleaning up historical Price Actions and Plans <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-61807</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>System administrators can now cleanup historical Price Actions and Plans so that system data size can be maintained. The new SQL stored procedure Pricing Plan and Action Cleanup is run as a Scheduled Task via Job Manager. </p>
        <p><b>NOTE</b>:&#160;This is a breaking change as this new nightly job needs to be configured to the customer data retention policies.</p>
        <h2>Evaluating Price Validation failures at the Variant and Site level <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-61186</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>You can now evaluate Pricing Validation failures at a Variant and Site level, so that there are fewer records to evaluate. Additionally, there is now the ability to set overrides at the Variant level. To enable this functionality, set the system policy <b>Advanced Validation Log</b> to True.</p>
