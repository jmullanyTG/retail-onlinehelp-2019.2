        <h2>Marking a Promotion in the Events and Promotions modules as Private, Public, or Shared <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print">DMDEV-59740</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Demand Management v2019.2 introduces new functionality in the Events and Promotions modules. A Promotion owner can now designate a Promotion as Private or Shared thereby restricting visibility and access to that Promotion to particular roles and users who have access to the Promotion owner’s categories within Event Layout, within Event List views, and within the "Available Promotions" window. The restricted Promotion’s privacy setting can later be changed to Public allowing all users visibility and access once the Promotion has passed. </p>
