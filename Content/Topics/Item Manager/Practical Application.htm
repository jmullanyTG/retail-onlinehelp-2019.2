        <h1>Practical Application</h1>
        <p>Opening and building an Inventory Manager view is a relatively simple task which gives users a high degree of flexibility. The easy to configure views can be used to create custom reports for any information within Demand Management. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Views may be created and opened in separate tabs within the Inventory Manager module. Upon opening a new view, users will be prompted to select a filter of inventories. </p>
