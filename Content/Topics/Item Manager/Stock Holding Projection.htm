        <h1>Stock Holding Projection</h1>
        <p>The stock holding projection tab will display the familiar “sawtooth” diagram which is key throughout the inventory planning process. Users can configure the colors of the various available series within the graph selecting a color palette which is most appealing and accessible for them.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> The ability to configure a series’ color requires user right <b>Allow Stock Projection Series Configuration</b>.</p>

        <p>An <b>Advanced Calculate</b> button displays when the item is a Replenishment item. This button requires <b>User Right Allow Stock Projection Calculation Using Advanced Calc button</b>.</p>
        <h2>Allocation vs Replenishment projections</h2>
        <p>The Stock Holding Projection tab displays allocation- or replenishment-related projections depending on whether the selected item is managed by the Allocations module or the </p>
        <p>Demand&#160;Forecasting/Inventory Planning/Replenishment suite ("Replenishment", for short).</p>
        <p>If you have both the Allocations module and the Replenishment suite enabled in your instance of Demand Management, the <b>Allocation Strategy Selection</b> field in the <a href="../Allocations/Allocation Strategy grid field reference.htm">Allocation Strategy</a> screen sets whether an item is managed by Allocations or Replenishment. You can add the <b>Execution Process</b> column to your Item Manager view to see which process manages each item. Its read-only values are "Allocations engine" or "Replenishment engine".</p>
