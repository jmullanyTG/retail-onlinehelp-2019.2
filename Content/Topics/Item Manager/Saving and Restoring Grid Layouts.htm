        <h1>Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts</h1>
        <p>In instances where users have constructed a report, they may wish to save the fields and layout for future use.</p>
        <ol>
            <li class="ListParagraph">First ensure that there are no filters active on your grid, check that there is no writing in the headers and also no items selected in the little funnels. If you make a mistake here then every time you open up your layout in the future it will open with the same filter applied.<p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Item Manager/Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 624px;height: 280px;" /></p><p><b>NOTE:</b> If you save a layout with filters applied you will get the behavior below each time you open your layout.</p><p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Item Manager/Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 451px;height: 94px;" /></p></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Right click anywhere on the data and select “Save Layout”  <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Item Manager/Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 344px;height: 266px;" /></p></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Give the Layout a meaningful name and then check or uncheck the default box depending on if you want this layout to be the default layout for you when you use the inventory manager. Most of the time you will choose private unless you are creating a layout that other members on your team will use.   <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Item Manager/Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 519px;height: 244px;" /></p></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Now when you are at the “Choose Fields” screen you will be able to quickly select a previously saved layout and easily get columns into the grid. <p><img src="../../Resources/Images/Item Manager/Saving and Restoring Grid Layouts_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 624px;height: 329px;" /></p></li>
