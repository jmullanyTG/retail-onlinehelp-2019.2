        </p>
        <p>The Configuration button will launch the Views Maintenance wizard, which may be used to select the views included as blades within the site manager detail section. If views are added or removed, users will need to refresh the plugins (or exit Demand Management and relaunch.) in order to see the changes. Each site detail blade is comprised of a view. As such, they may be set with individual user permissions to determine access. </p>
