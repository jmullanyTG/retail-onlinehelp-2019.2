        <h2>Exception-based filtering</h2>
        <p>You can use metadata to create exception filters that identify sites in need of additional configuration, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sites that have not yet been assigned to a <a href="../Cluster Site Manager/Filtering Sites in Site Clusters.htm">site cluster</a></li>
            <li>Sites that do not appear in any Allocation <a href="../Allocations/Filtering Sites in Location Strategies.htm">location strategies</a>.</li>
            <li>Sites that have not been added to a <a href="../Supply Chain/Filtering for Unconfigured Supply Chains.htm">supply chain.</a> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ul>
