        <h1>Modify Price Action Statuses</h1>
        <p>The Price Action Status provides the ability to drive corporate configured processes and associated permissions by roles and users, for each Status, as well as provide communication between Statuses that can be reviewed to understand the lifecycle of the Pricing Action. </p>
        <h2>Changing Price Action statuses</h2>
        <p>You can change Price Action statuses by clicking the <b>Change Status(es)</b> button to display a drop-down menu that allows you to change the status of a single Price Action or change the status of multiple Price Action at one time. The ability to change multiple Price Action Statuses at the same time so that the Price Action may proceed in their life-cycle, whether for approval or to send to downstream systems, greatly reduces  the repetition associated with opening and changing the Status for each and every Price Action.</p>
        <p>The menu options are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change Status</li>
            <li>Change Multiple Statuses</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Change Status</h3>
        <p>The <b>Change Status</b> menu option is based on the Price Actions selected in the List grid. Selecting this option opens the <b>Change Status</b> dialog. </p>

        </p>
        <p>This menu option is enabled when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The Price Action Start Date is today or in the future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>The Price Action State is not <b>Calculation Required</b>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The user has User Rights to modify the Price Action status in its current Workflow Status State.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The User has permissions to the next Workflow Transition.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Change Multiple Statuses</h3>
        <p>The <b>Change Multiple Statuses</b> menu option is based on ALL the Price Actions displayed in the List grid. Selecting this option opens the <b>Change Statuses</b> dialog. </p>
