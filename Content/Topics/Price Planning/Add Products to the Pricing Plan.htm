        <h1>Modifying the products included in a Pricing Plan</h1>
        <p>To add products to a Pricing Plan, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add</span> on the Pricing Plan <b>Variants</b> grid. The solution provides two methods to identify additional products: using filter criteria or using the system clipboard. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Add from Filter</p>
        <p>Clicking <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add from Filter</span> will display the filter window so that you can choose an existing filter or click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintain Filters</span> to create a new filter. Once a filter is selected click <span style="font-weight: bold;">OK</span> to append any new products to the existing product listing and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> to commit any changes.</p>
        <p>If active Pricing Action(s) exist, the system will allow you to apply the new products using the Action’s Summary level entered values. If you are unable to add products, the Pricing Action may be in a status that does not allow modification with your rights.</p>

        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Add from Clipboard</p>
        <p>You can add products by selecting the right-click menu option <b>Copy Column Cell(s)</b> in the Product grid and then selecting <b>Add</b> &gt; <b>from Clipboard</b>. </p>
        <p>The system will validate all entries and will log all failed products for investigation by you. Successful entries will be added to the Pricing Plan and the system will allow you to act immediately on the new products by adding to a Pricing Action. </p>

        <h2>Remove products from the Pricing Plan<br></br></h2>
        <p>To remove products from the Pricing Plan, click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove</span> on the Pricing Plan Variant grid. The solution provides two (2) methods to identify products to be removed: manually selected or using the system clipboard.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Manual Selection</p>
        <p>To remove products from the Pricing Plan, select and mark the checkbox adjacent to the appropriate product(s) in the Pricing Plan Variant grid and click <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Selected</span>.</p>
        <p>The system will not allow removal of product(s) from the Pricing Plan if the product(s) are being used in a Pricing Action.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Remove from Clipboard</p>
        <p>You will be able to remove products directly from their system clipboard with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remove from Clipboard</span> button. The copied list should have one (1) product (i.e. Variant or Item Master, global policy) per line, followed by a carriage return line feed.</p>
        <p>The system will validate all entries and will log all failed products for investigation by you. For successful entries and upon your confirmation, the system will remove the products and recalculate the Pricing Action(s).</p>
