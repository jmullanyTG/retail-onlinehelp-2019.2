Through creative use of PivotGrid functionality, users can quickly aggregate, disaggregate, and rearrange fields in the view, allowing for a more intuitive and fluid process. In contrast with previous versions of MFP, version 3.6.0 allows for live editing of all plannable metrics without the need to invoke lock types.</p>
