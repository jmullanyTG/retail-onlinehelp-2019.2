        <h1 class="Heading1">Merchandise Financial Planning Overview</h1>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Financial Planning module </span>combines <span style="color: #000000;">essential</span><span style="color: #000000;"> planning </span><span style="color: #000000;">functionality, such as Cost and Retail methods of accounting, calendar and period level configurability, and plan approval workflow with an innovative approach to data management and user interaction. In the Financial Planning module, selecting an accounting method is just the beginning – from there, users can define a custom metric set and views of their choosing from the full balanced set of metrics available to BOTH methods. </span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">Users have the ability to alter calculation direction for metrics where multiple directions may be desired (such as an option to calculate Sales Units or AUR when changing Sales) without refreshing the screen for the change to take effect. Flexible metric locking capabilities allow users to both hold specific period level values while spreading changes around them and lock aggregate level values, constraining changes made at lower levels to the locked totals</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, all of this functionality is wrapped in a fully configurable PivotGrid, behaving much like a Microsoft Excel Pivot Table but allowing edits of plannable metrics at any level of the product, site, and time hierarchies and effortlessly aggregating and disaggregating data via simple drag-and-drop user actions.</span>
