        <h1>Managing Layout Groups</h1>
        <p>Layouts can be organized into groups, which makes it easier to find the layout you are looking for when restoring a layout or data layout. You can add, delete, and edit groups from the Save Layout dialog box. Changes are reflected in both the Restore Layout and Restore Data Layout context menus. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Note:&#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">Administrator rights are required to manage groups.</span></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Right-click in the data area of the grid and choose <b>Save Layout</b>.</li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Save Layout dialog box, click the "<b>...</b>" button next to the Group list.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the Group Management dialog box:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click <b>New</b> to create a new group.</li>
                    <li>Click <b>Edit</b> to edit the selected group.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Click <b>Delete</b> to delete the selected group. Any layouts contained in a deleted group are moved to the main (ungrouped) list of layouts.</p>

            </li>
            <li>Click <b>OK</b> in the Group Management dialog box to save your changes. </li>
            <li>If you want to make changes to the current layout, such as saving it to a new group, click <b>OK</b> in the Save Layout dialog box. Otherwise, you can click <b>Cancel</b> without affecting the changes made to your groups.</li>
