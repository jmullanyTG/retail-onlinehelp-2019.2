        <h1 class="Heading1">Product Groups</h1>
        <p>Product groups are meant to be used as a mechanism for distributing inventory outside of the organized product hierarch. This may be used to allocate hierarchy independent collections or sets, or to deal with mismatched and excess inventory for clearance purposes. </p>
        <p>All product groups are user configured and may be built to serve many purposes. Product groups are built out of variants, and are represented as a single strategy line within the Allocation Strategy. </p>
        <p>Users may create, edit, and delete product groups. </p>
