        <h1>List</h1>
        <p>The Slot Set List view displays the Slots in the selected Slot Set as rows in a grid. Access to this screen depends on the user’s rights.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/List_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 624px;height: 200px;" />
        </p>
        <p>For each Slot, the attributes are displayed as columns. </p>
        <p>Every Slot Set has a Position 0 Slot. This is where all unadvertised Promotions will be located for the Slot Set. Position 0 does not have an associated Item Display Format, Space, and the Status is ‘Unassigned’.</p>
        <h2>Private Promotions</h2>
        <p>If the logged in user selects a Promotion that has not been shared with them, then:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the Promotion name in <b>Assigned Promotion</b> displays as Private.</li>
            <li>All fields except <b>Item Display Format</b> and <b>Space</b> are masked.</li>
            <li>the ability to modify <b>Item Display Format</b> and <b>Space</b> is disabled.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Displaying the View/Edit Promotion screen</h2>
        <p>To preview a particular slot, double-click on a row in the grid to display the Promotion preview screen.</p>
        <h2>Previewing a Promotion</h2>
        <p>Selecting a slot in the grid refreshes the Slot Preview Pane (located to the right of the Promotion pane that displays the Promotions available to be added to the Event).  If the Promotion has been shared with the logged in user (the Promotion’s privacy option is Public or Shared with the logged in user), the Promotion preview dialog will be displayed, but is read-only.</p>
        <h3>Previewing private Promotions</h3>
        <p>The Promotion preview pane is masked and displays the following graphic if the logged in user double-clicks a slot with a Promotion that has not been shared with them.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Event Version Masked Promotion.PNG" />
        </p>
        <h2> Selecting Geographies and available Promotions</h2>
        <p>Selecting a Slot in the grid, will refresh the Geography and Available Promotions panes below the grid. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/List_1_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 576px;height: 239px;" />
        </p>
        <h3>Geography pane</h3>
        <p>The Geography pane indicates which Geographies will be automatically assigned to the Promotion when it is added to the Slot. If the logged in user selects a Promotion that has not been shared with them (the Promotion is private to other users), then the <b>Assign</b> button is disabled.</p>
        <h3>Available Promotions pane</h3>
        <p>The available Promotions pane indicates which Promotions are available to add to the Slot. A Promotion with a check mark indicates that it has been added to the Slot Set but not necessarily to the selected Slot. If a Promotion is assigned to the selected Slot, it will be the only one displayed in the Promotions pane.</p>
        <p>The Available Promotions pane displays Promotions with Sales Dates that overlap the Event Sale Dates. There are several buttons available above the Promotions pane:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Available Promotions pane.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 480px;height: 25px;" />
        </p>
        <p><b>NOTES:</b>&#160;The available Promotions pane:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>does not display Promotions that have been designated Private.</p>
                <p>Promotions that have not been shared with the logged in user (the Promotion is private to other users) do not display in the Available Promotions pane though they do display as Private Promotions in the Slot Set List view to denote the Slot has been populated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>displays Promotions designated as Public.</li>
            <li>displays Promotions that have been shared with the logged in user or the role the logged in user belongs to.</li>
            <li>displays Promotions that are Private to the logged in user.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on the Global Policy <b>Promotion Double Click Action</b> setting, double clicking on an assigned Promotion in the grid will load the Promotion in either a window or in the Promotions solution.</p>
        <h2>Promotions menu</h2>
        <p>The following functionality is available in the Promotions menu on the toolbar:</p>
