        <h1>Editing Slot Set Layouts</h1>
        <p>Layout Edit Mode, available from the Layout view, is the only place where you can edit the design of event slot slots. From here, you can customize slots, their positions, space assignment, and item display format assignment. Certain actions may be restricted based on <a href="../Users/Events Management User Rights.htm">user rights</a>.</p>
        <p>To toggle entering/exiting Layout Edit Mode from the Layout view:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Click the Layout Edit button <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Layout edit.png" style="width: 21px; height: 19px;" class="icon" /> (located about the slot set preview, next to the Zoom slider).</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/layout edit 1.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once in Layout Edit mode, the toolbar actions change and new panes appear in the right side of the Layout view.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Slot Information pane, located in the top-right of the view, shows property details of the selected slot.</li>
            <li>
                <p>The Space Allocation pane, located in the bottom-right of the view, shows space allocation by slot set and the overall event.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/layout edit screen.png" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Private Promotions that are not shared with the logged in user</h2>
        <p>Promotions that are private to the logged in user cannot be split or merged. Promotions that are adjacent to a private Promotion cannot be merged to the private Promotion. For example, a public Promotion to the right of a private Promotion cannot be merged left and the purple line does not appear. Also, logged in users cannot split a Promotion that is private to them.</p>
        <p>Promotions in the Slot Set that have not been shared with the logged in user are indicated by the following:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Campaigns and Events/Event Version Masked Promotion.PNG" />
        </p>
        <h2>Actions</h2>
        <p>You can perform the following actions while in Layout Edit Mode.</p>
