        <h1>Versions</h1>
        <p>A Slot Set Version is the result of a combination of Promotion, Content and Pricing assigned to Geographies. Each Version consists of a distinct set of content and pricing across one or more Geographies. The versioning order is based on the order of Geographies in the Event’s Geography Set.&#160; The first Geography in the set provides a constant for determining the Base Version for the Slot Set.&#160; Further versions are grouped by their highest ranked Geography.</p>
        <h2>Bases</h2>
        <p>Slot Set Versions are displayed as across the bottom of the screen; each Base with a letter identifier, such as Base A, Base B, etc. By selecting a Base Version from the bottom of the screen, the Slot Set display, Geography pane and Site Names pane will refresh to display the associated Version information.</p>
        <h2>Private Promotions</h2>
        <p> Details for a Promotion that has not been shared with the logged in user are masked as follows to indicate that the Slot is still assigned a Promotion.<br /><![CDATA[                  ]]></p>
