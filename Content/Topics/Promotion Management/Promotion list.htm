        <h1>Promotion list</h1>
        <p>The <b>List</b> screen provides a filtered list of Promotions with the ability to view or edit or create new, depending on your permissions. In the grid, the first checkbox column allows you to select multiple Promotions for deletion. </p>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> Promotions marked as Private to other users do not display. The promotions that do display are those marked Public and those promotions shared with your user or the role(s) that your user belongs to.</p>

        <p>Double-clicking a promotion in the grid displays a Promotion Detail screen as a separate tab.</p>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Promotion Management1/Promotion Details screen.PNG" /></p>
        <p>The available Promotion Strategies displayed in the Promotion Detail Site Cluster grid are filtered based on the Promotion Strategy’s restricted User and Role access. </p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If a previously selected Promotion Strategy is no longer valid, then the system retains the now restricted Promotion Strategy. However, once the user selects a different Promotion Strategy the restricted Promotion Strategy is no longer available.</p>
