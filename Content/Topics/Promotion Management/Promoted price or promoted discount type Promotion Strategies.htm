        <h1>Promoted price or promoted discount type Promotion Strategies</h1>
        <p>For Promoted Price and Promoted Discount type Promotion Strategies there are three ways to add products. The three methods of adding products are not mutually exclusive and all three methods can be used within a Promotion.</p>
        <h2>Adding a Variant</h2>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Click <b>Add Variant</b>.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">
                <p>In the <b>Add Variants</b> dialog, enter a product code (for Variant or Item Master, depending on the global policy) in the <b>Products</b> field or select the <b>Add Variants From Clipboard</b> button.</p>
                <p><b>NOTE:</b>&#160;Variant codes can be copied using the right-click menu option <b>Copy Column Cell(s</b>).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Click <b>Ok</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Using a filter to add products</h2>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Click <b>Select to Add</b>.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">
                <p>In the <b>Variants</b> dialog, click the dropdown arrow in the <b>Filter</b> field and select a filter.</p>
                <p><b>NOTE:</b> If an appropriate filter does not exist click, click on the black hammer icon to create a new filter.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">If required, select the check box <b>Select only some items from the current filter</b> for individual product selection from the selected filter.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Once the appropriate Filter is selected, click <b>Ok</b>. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Adding a Variant group</h2>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">
				Click <b>Add Variant Group</b>.
			</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">If required, click <b>Filter</b> to change which filter is being used.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">In&#160;the <b>Select Variant Groups to Add</b> dialog, select the check box for each group to be added to the Promotion. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Click <b>Ok</b>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>NOTES:</b><![CDATA[      ]]></p>
        <ul class="ul_3">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If the group you wish to add is not available, first ensure the filter selected in the pop up is for “All Variants/Item Masters”. If still unavailable, navigate to Content Manager to create the group you require for the Promotion.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">These groups are dynamic, meaning the system will update the associated products included in the group dependent on the filter criteria used to create the group. This update will only occur as long as the Promotion is in an unlocked state.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">When adding a group to a Promotion, the system creates a copy of the original group, including the filter criteria used to define the Group, so that changes can be made at the Promotion level without affecting the originating product group.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>For information on creating, editing, and deleting filters, refer to the Filters section in the online help.</p>
