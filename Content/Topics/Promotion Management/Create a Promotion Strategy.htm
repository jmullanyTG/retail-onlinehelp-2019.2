        <h1>Create a Promotion Strategy</h1>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">Within the Promotion Strategy screen, click <b>New</b> to create a new Promotion Strategy. Clicking <b>New</b> adds a new blank row at the end of the rows in the <b>Promotion Strategies</b> grid. Complete the fields as required in the <b>Promotion Strategies</b> pane and then select the check boxes as required in the <b>Promotion Strategy Field Requirements</b> pane. </p>
        <h2>Removing access from Roles and Users to a new Promotion Strategy</h2>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1">By default, all Roles and Users have access to all new Promotion Strategies. To maintain corporate compliance across advertising channels, click on the <b>Edit User Access</b> field to restrict access to Roles and Users as required (Moving a Role or User to the <b>Remove Role\User</b> column does not affect any current Promotions).  Once Roles and Uses have been selected, click <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <p class="NormalWeb_1"><b>NOTE:</b> Only active Roles and Users that have User Right Allow Creation of Promotion are displayed in the <b>Remove User Rights</b> dialog.</p>
