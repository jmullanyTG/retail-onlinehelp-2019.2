        <h1>Attribute Management Module</h1>
        <p>The Attribute Management Module can be found in the Maintain section of the software. The attribute management module will be available to any customer who uses assortment planning. It was put into a standalone module because it can be used to define attributes throughout the system all the way down to a product/location level.</p>

        <p>This module contains two tabs “Attribute Management” and “Attribute Sets”. These two tabs are interconnected through the assignment of attribute families to attribute sets. Each of these tabs will be detailed in this document.</p>
