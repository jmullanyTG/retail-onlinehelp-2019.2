        <h1>Rate of Sale Calculator – Assortment Planning ROS Scenario Results</h1>
        <p>Once scenarios have been calculated, users can review the resulting rates of sale by defined performance bands (set during configuration) as both raw and adjusted (cleansed) values.&#160; The results are grouped into the following performance percentiles (configurable during implementation):  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum</li>
            <li>25th percentile</li>
            <li>Median (50th percentile)</li>
            <li>75th percentile</li>
            <li>Maximum</li>
            <li>Average (default selection)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;NOTE: &lt;/b&gt;">Average shows the true average rate of sale per variant/period for the selected data, not the average from the configured percentile bands</p>
