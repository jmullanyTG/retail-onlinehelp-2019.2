        <h1>Broker Dispatch Overview</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this document is to specify the basic high level concepts of the Demand Management Broker Dispatch Service, detailing the domains it provides solutions for as well as how this system augments the Demand Management Solution in its entirety.</p>
        <p>The Demand Management Broker Dispatch Service (JEBDS) primarily solves two requirements for Demand Management. The first and most important objective is that the JEBDS provides a generic end point for the Database processes (Stored Procedures / Functions / General SQL scripts) to communicate bi-directionally with Demand Management Developed Endpoints (Web services / Engines / Smart Clients). This allows the Database to be able to address or call Demand Management Developed Endpoints and receive computed results or execute actions originating from these endpoints on their behalf.</p>
        <p>The second objective the JEBDS solves is providing a time based job scheduler which will facilitate the execution of Demand Management specific jobs or tasks periodically at either fixed times, dates or intervals. In addition JEBDS will replace Demand Managements’ existing scheduler mechanism with a more intelligent and robust solution, be more performant and reliable, and cater for even more scenarios whilst allowing the system to have more granular control over its execution modes.</p>
